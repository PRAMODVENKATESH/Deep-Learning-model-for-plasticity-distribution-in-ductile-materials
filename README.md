# Deep-Learning-model-to-predict-plasticity-distribution-in-ductile-materials
This project was developed as a part of my master's thesis, a preliminary approach was developed to predict the microscopic strength reduction in ductile materials using a CNN for regression analysis.
The persisting problem at frontier in the study of softening in ductile materials, has been the development of simplistic models, eliminating the need for tedious numerical analysis. In this research work, a preliminary study is carried out to unearth the possibility of implementingmachine learning to apprehend the distribution of plasticity around a growing void. Precisely, the model employs the deep learning (DL) framework for a regression analysis on twodimensionalrepresentative volume element (RVE) of a porous-plastic material.
In recent times, deep neural networks are used in wide areas of scientific research owing to their exceptional ability of extracting features automatically, understanding the patterns and the adaptability offered by these networks to a plethora of research problems. Neural networks have the ability to approximate any given function, with lesser computational requirements compared to traditional numerical methods.
The deep neural network architecture employed in this work is built using convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN with hand crafted features have enjoyed enormous success in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from image classification to object detection, while regression analysis performed using CNN are fewer compared to classification; they have great potential to perform regression tasks with minimal error in the predicted output. The feature extraction layers of the CNN model employed in this work is built based on DenseNet architecture. The input (RVE simulations of void growth) and the target value which is a total reaction force associated with each input image (provided during the training of neural network) are generated using ABAQUS. The network is built on a web IDE (integrated development environment) developed by google colaboratory which offers the usage of free GPU to speed up the computation. The model is then trained and hyperparameters are tuned empirically to obtain good convergence to the desired result. An unbiased evaluation of the model is performed on test datasets which are unseen by the model during training. The ground truth values and predicted values obtained on train and test dataset are presented in the form of a linear plot.
The deep learning model successfully captured the distribution of plasticity around two dimensional RVE of ductile material. The model demonstrated good generalization by
predicting the total reaction force associated to each test image dataset with very minimal mean error(0.45N) and maximum error (2N) between the predicted and ground truth values of total reaction force.
The model also captures accurately the trend in softening of ductile matrix with progressive growth of the void.
